== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is sentiment analysis, and how does your plugin work? =

Sentiment analysis is a process of determining the emotional tone of a piece of content, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. Our plugin uses keyword-based analysis to detect sentiment by scanning for specific words or phrases in posts, comments, or reviews. It then categorizes the content based on the overall emotional tone detected.

= Can I customize the sentiment categories? =

Yes! While the default categories are positive, negative, and neutral, our plugin allows you to customize sentiment classifications. You can add additional categories like "mixed" or "ambiguous," or tailor the sentiment analysis to different regional dialects and languages based on your needs.

= How do the badges work? =

Badges are automatically assigned to each post based on its sentiment. A positive post will be marked with a green badge, a negative post with a red badge, and neutral posts with a yellow badge. These badges serve as quick visual indicators, allowing you to assess sentiment at a glance.

= Can I filter posts based on sentiment or keywords? =

Yes! The plugin provides advanced filtering options that allow you to sort posts by sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), specific keywords, and even date ranges. This feature helps you quickly locate and analyze the most relevant content for your needs.

= Is the sentiment analysis updated in real-time? =

Yes, the plugin provides real-time updates to sentiment analysis. This ensures that you’re always aware of changes in sentiment as new posts are made, allowing you to respond quickly to shifts in user feedback.
